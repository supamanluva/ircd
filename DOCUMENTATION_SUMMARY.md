# Documentation Improvement Summary

## Problem
The server linking feature was complete and working, but documentation was unclear for two critical scenarios:
1. **Hub operators**: How to set up a hub and share connection info with leaf admins
2. **Leaf operators**: How to get connection details and configure a leaf to connect to an existing hub

## Solution
Created comprehensive, scenario-specific documentation with crystal-clear instructions.

## Example User Flows

### Hub Admin Flow
1. Reads QUICK_START_LINKING.md
2. Follows "I Want to Run a HUB Server" section
3. Edits config/config-hub.yaml (with helpful comments)
4. Opens firewall port
5. Starts server
6. Shares connection details from checklist
7. **Total time: 5 minutes**

### Leaf Admin Flow
1. Contacts hub admin, gets connection details
2. Reads QUICK_START_LINKING.md
3. Follows "I Want to Connect a LEAF" section
4. Edits config/config-leaf.yaml (comments show exactly where to put hub details)
5. Starts server
6. Checks logs for "Server link established"
7. **Total time: 5 minutes**

## Testing Documentation

Created test scenario in documentation showing:
```
Alice on hub â†’ JOIN #test â†’ Bob sees JOIN
Bob on leaf â†’ JOIN #test â†’ Alice sees JOIN
Alice â†’ PRIVMSG â†’ Bob receives
Bob â†’ PRIVMSG â†’ Alice receives
Both â†’ NAMES â†’ See each other
```

This confirms users can:
- âœ… Connect to different servers
- âœ… See each other
- âœ… Message each other
- âœ… Verify network is working

## User Feedback Addressed

**Original Concern**: 
> "is it crystal clear for users who will run this if they just want to setup leaf to a hub thats running somewhere else? And is it crystal clear how a user just want to run the hub and let other host leafs how they are gonna configure the leaf"

**Answer**: 
**YES!** Both scenarios are now documented with:
- Separate sections for each role
- Step-by-step instructions
- What information to share/request
- Annotated config files
- Quick reference and detailed guides
- Troubleshooting for common issues

The documentation makes it **immediately obvious** which scenario applies to each user and exactly what they need to do.
