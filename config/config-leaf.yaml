# Server Linking - Leaf Server
#
# This server acts as a LEAF - it CONNECTS to a hub server.
# This server will initiate the connection to the hub.
#
# To use:
# 1. Get connection details from your hub admin:
#    - Hub address (IP or domain)
#    - Hub link port
#    - Hub server_id
#    - Hub server name
#    - Link password
# 2. Set linking.enabled to true
# 3. Choose a unique server_id (NOT the same as hub! e.g., "002", "003", etc.)
# 4. Set linking.password to match the hub's password
# 5. Configure the "links" section below with hub details
# 6. Set auto_connect to true
#
# The leaf will automatically connect to the hub on startup!
#
linking:
  enabled: true
  host: "0.0.0.0"                       # Your server's link listener (in case hub connects back)
  port: 7778                             # YOUR link port (must be different from hub!)
  server_id: "1BB"                       # Unique 3-char ID (DIFFERENT from hub's "0AA"!)
  description: "Test IRC Leaf Server"
  password: "linkpass123"                # Must MATCH hub's password!

    # Configure the HUB server connection here
