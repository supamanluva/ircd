- Industry-standard password hashing
- Built-in salting
- Adjustable cost factor
- Resistant to brute-force attacks
- Constant-time comparison

## Migration Notes

### Configuration Changes
Added operators section to `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
operators:
  - name: "admin"
    password: "$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy"
  - name: "oper"
    password: "$2a$10$e0MYzXyjpJS7Pd94qMTnYu8qgx7Ky5.XYVzMSrVPXpLDXbDdSQT0W"
```

### Database/State Changes
None - all features are memory-based and ephemeral.

### Breaking Changes
None - all additions are backward compatible.

## Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- Channel keys: ~100 bytes per protected channel
- Voice status: ~8 bytes per voiced user
- Away messages: ~256 bytes average per away user
- Operator hashes: ~60 bytes per operator (in config)

**Total Impact:** Minimal - ~10KB for typical usage

### CPU Usage
- bcrypt verification: ~100ms per OPER attempt (by design)
- Other commands: <1ms average

### Network Usage
- Slightly increased due to additional replies
- Well within acceptable limits

## Known Limitations

1. **Channel Keys:**
   - No key rotation
   - No expiration
   - Plain text comparison (bcrypt-ready structure)

2. **Voice Mode:**
   - Not persistent across disconnects
   - No auto-voice lists

3. **OPER Command:**
   - No host-based restrictions
   - No operator classes/levels
   - Config reload requires restart

4. **Away Status:**
   - Not persistent
   - No away log
   - No auto-away

5. **USERHOST/ISON:**
   - No rate limiting
   - Could be used for presence tracking
